## 1. Introduction

The most common tracker for Snowplow users to get started with is the [JavaScript Tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-javascript-tracker). Like all our trackers, you can use it to track the self-describing events and entities that you define yourself. In addition, Snowplow provides built-in support for the web-native events that most users will want to track. This includes events such as page views, page pings, and link clicks.

The Snowplow SQL data model makes it easier to get started with web data. It aggregates the page view and page ping events to create a set of derived tables that contain a lot of detail, including: time engaged, scroll depth, and page performance. The model comes in three variants:

1. A straightforward set of [SQL queries](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/5-data-modeling/web-model/redshift)  
Use this version to model your web events data in Amazon Redshift.
2. A variant optimized for [SQL Runner](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/feature/web-models/5-data-modeling/web-model/sql-runner)  
SQL Runner is an [open source app](https://github.com/snowplow/sql-runner) that makes it easy to execute SQL statements programmatically as part of a Snowplow data pipeline. This version of the model includes all the SQL queries that make up the model, as well as a playbook you can use to update the tables whenever there's new data.
3. A variant optimized for [Looker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/feature/web-models/5-data-modeling/web-model/looker)  
Looker is a modern [BI tool](https://looker.com/) that can be used to model and explore Snowplow data. Use this version to quickly set up a Looker Block with the Snowplow web data model.


## 2. Requirements

To use this model you must have already set up Snowplow data tracking on your website. You will also need to have enabled the `webPage` context.

Find more information on how to set up Snowplow tracking via the [JavaScript tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/javascript-tracker).

Find more information on the `webPage` [context](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/1-General-parameters-for-the-Javascript-tracker-v2.6#webPage).


### 2.1 Recommended requirements

To be able to run the model 'as is' and take full advantage of all options, you will need to be using version 2.6.0+ of the Snowplow JavaScript tracker and Snowplow 71+. The `webPage` context must be enabled. You should also enable the `geolocation` and `performanceTiming` contexts, and the `ua_parser` and `campaign_attribution` enrichments.

Find more information about the `geolocation` [context](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/1-General-parameters-for-the-Javascript-tracker#geolocation).

Find more information about the `performanceTiming` [context](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/1-General-parameters-for-the-Javascript-tracker-v2.6#performanceTiming).

Find more information about the `ua_parser` [enrichment](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/ua-parser-enrichment).

Find more information about the `campaign_attribution` [enrichment](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Campaign-attribution-enrichment).


### 2.2 Minimum requirements

You must be using version 2.5.0+ of the JavaScript tracker for the `webPage` context to work. This context is required and you will not be able to use the model without it.

The `geolocation` and `performanceTiming` contexts, and the `ua_parser` and `campaign_attribution` enrichments are optional. You will still be able to use the model without them but you will have to comment out the relevant parts from the SQL code.

By default, the model uses the more accurate `derived_tstamp` which makes allowance for inaccurate device clocks. This timestamp is only available in version 2.6.0+ of the JavaScript tracker and Snowplow 71+. If you are using older versions, you will need to change the relevant timestamps in the SQL code.


## 3. Understanding the individual fields

In order to analyse Snowplow data, it is important to understand how it is structured.


### 3.1 Page Views table


#### 3.1.1 User fields

| Field                          | Type | Description                                    | Example                                |
| :---                           | :--- | :---                                           | :---                                   |
| `user_custom_id`               | text | Unique ID set by business                      | 'jon.doe@email.com'                    |
| `user_snowplow_domain_id`      | text | User ID set by Snowplow using 1st party cookie | 'bc2e92ec6c204a14'                     |
| `user_snowplow_crossdomain_id` | text | User ID set by Snowplow using 3rd party cookie | 'ecdff4d0-9175-40ac-a8bb-325c49733607' |


#### 3.1.2 Session fields

| Field           | Type | Description                  | Example                               |
| :---            | :--- | :---                         | :---                                  |
| `session_id`    | text | A visit / session identifier | 'c6ef3124-b53a-4b13-a233-0088f79dcbcb'|
| `session_index` | int  | A visit / session index      | 3                                     |

`session_index` is the number of the current user session. For example, an event occurring during a user's first session would have `session_index` set to 1.


#### 3.1.3 Page view fields

| Field                        | Type | Description                               | Example                                |
| :---                         | :--- | :---                                      | :---                                   |
| `page_view_id`               | text | UUID                                      | 'e7c41b46-f449-49a0-a8ef-9a4037944004' |
| `page_view_index`            | int  | A page view index                         | 3                                      |
| `page_view_in_session_index` | int  | A page view index within a single session | 1                                      |

`page_view_index` is the number of the current page view. For example, if this is the second page viewed by the user, `page_view_index` will be set to 2.

`page_view_in_session_index` is the number of the current page view within the current session. Consider the example of a user who views two pages on their first visit and three more on their second visit. The second page view of the second visit will be their fourth overall. Hence `page_view_index` will be set to 4 but `page_view_in_session_index` will be set to 2.


#### 3.1.4 Time fields


##### 3.1.4.1 Core time fields

| Field                   | Type      | Description                                                      | Example                      |
| :---                    | :---      | :---                                                             | :---                         |
| `page_view_start`       | timestamp | Timestamp for the start of the page view on your preferred clock | '2015-11-17 04:13:53.000000' |
| `page_view_end`         | timestamp | Timestamp for the end of the page view on your preferred clock   | '2015-11-17 04:16:03.997000' |
| `page_view_start_local` | timestamp | Timestamp for the start of the page view on the user's clock     | '2015-11-17 15:13:53.000000' |
| `page_view_end_local`   | timestamp | Timestamp for the end of the page view on the user's clock       | '2015-11-17 15:16:03.000000' |

The timestamps are calculated by default from the `derived_tstamp`. Change this in the SQL code if you want to use a different timestamp.

The time zone for `page_view_start` and `page_view_end` is set in the SQL code. The time zone for `page_view_start_local` and `page_view_end_local` is derived from the time zone of the OS.


##### 3.1.4.2 Optional time fields

As well as the core timestamp fields, you can also have a variety of derived time fields. Some examples are already included in the code for this model. They are:

| Field                               | Type | Description                                                            | Example               |
| :---                                | :--- | :---                                                                   | :---                  |
| `page_view_time`                    | text | Time derived from `page_view_start`                                    | '2015-11-17 04:13:53' |
| `page_view_minute`                  | text | Time derived from `page_view_start`, truncated to the minute           | '2015-11-17 04:13'    |
| `page_view_hour`                    | text | Time derived from `page_view_start`, truncated to the hour             | '2015-11-17 04'       |
| `page_view_date`                    | text | Date derived from `page_view_start`                                    | '2015-11-17'          |
| `page_view_week`                    | text | Year, month and week number derived from `page_view_start`             | '2015-11-16'          |
| `page_view_month`                   | text | Year and month derived from `page_view_start`                          | '2015-11'             |
| `page_view_quarter`                 | text | Quarter derived from `page_view_start`                                 | '2015-10'             |
| `page_view_year`                    | int  | Year derived from `page_view_start`                                    | 2015                  |
| `page_view_local_time`              | text | Time derived from `page_view_start_local`                              | '2015-11-17 15:13:53' |
| `page_view_local_time_of_day`       | text | Hour and minute derived from `page_view_start_local`                   | '15:13'               |
| `page_view_local_hour_of_day`       | int  | Hour derived from `page_view_start_local`                              | 15                    |
| `page_view_local_day_of_week`       | text | Day of week derived from `page_view_start_local`, on a scale of 1 to 7 | '4'                   |
| `page_view_local_day_of_week_index` | int  | Day of week derived from `page_view_start_local`, on a scale of 0 to 6 | 0                     |

`page_view_quarter` indicates the quarter by the starting month, so '2015-10' is the 'October quarter', or 'Q4'.


#### 3.1.5 Engagement fields

| Field                               | Type    | Description                                       | Example       |
| :---                                | :---    | :---                                              | :---          |
| `time_engaged_in_s`                 | int     | Time spent by the user on the page                | 70            |
| `time_engaged_in_s_tier`            | text    | Range of time spent by the user on the page       | '60s or more' |
| `horizontal_pixels_scrolled`        | int     | Distance the user scrolled horizontally in pixels | 0             |
| `vertical_pixels_scrolled`          | int     | Distance the user scrolled vertically in pixels   | 1948          |
| `horizontal_percentage_scrolled`    | int     | Percentage of page scrolled horizontally          | 100           |
| `vertical_percentage_scrolled`      | int     | Percentage of page scrolled vertically            | 52            |
| `vertical_percentage_scrolled_tier` | text    | Range of percentage of page scrolled vertically   | '50% to 74%'  |
| `user_bounced`                      | boolean | Did the user bounce?                              | FALSE         |
| `user_engaged`                      | boolean | Did the user engage with the page?                | TRUE          |

`time_engaged_in_s` assumes `page_ping`s have been set to fire every 10 seconds. Change the setting in the SQL code to match your own settings.

`user_bounced` and `user_engaged` are derived from `time_engaged_in_s` and `vertical_percentage_scrolled`. Users who engage with the page for 0 seconds are counted as 'bounced'. Users who engage with the page for 30 seconds or more and scroll to see at least 25% of the content on the page are counted as 'engaged'.


#### 3.1.6 Page fields

#### 3.2.3 Time fields


##### 3.2.3.1 Core time fields

| Field                 | Type      | Description                                                    | Example                      |
| :---                  | :---      | :---                                                           | :---                         |
| `session_start`       | timestamp | Timestamp for the start of the session on your preferred clock | '2015-07-20 10:35:22.441000' |
| `session_end`         | timestamp | Timestamp for the end of the session on your preferred clock   | '2015-07-20 12:38:17.238000' |
| `session_start_local` | timestamp | Timestamp for the start of the session on the user's clock     | '2015-07-20 15:05:22.441000' |
| `session_end_local`   | timestamp | Timestamp for the end of the session on the user's clock       | '2015-07-20 17:08:17.238000' |

`session_start` corresponds to the first value of `page_view_start` within that session; and `session_end` corresponds to the last `page_view_end` within that session.

The timestamps are calculated by default from the `derived_tstamp`. Change this in the SQL code if you want to use a different timestamp.

The time zone for `session_start` and `session_end` is set in the SQL code when defining the `page_view_start` and `page_view_end` fields. The time zone for `session_start_local` and `session_end_local` is derived from the time zone of the OS (by way of `page_view_start_local` and `page_view_end_local`).


##### 3.2.3.2 Optional time fields

As well as the core timestamp fields, you can also have a variety of derived time fields. Some examples are already included in the code for this model. They are:

| :---                  | :---      | :---                                                           | :---                         |
| `first_session_start`       | timestamp | Timestamp for the start of the user's first session on your preferred clock | '2015-07-20 10:35:22.441000' |
| `first_session_start_local` | timestamp | Timestamp for the start of the user's first session on the user's clock     | '2015-07-20 15:05:22.441000' |
| `last_session_end`         | timestamp | Timestamp for the end of the user's last session on your preferred clock   | '2015-07-20 12:38:17.238000' |

`first_session_start` corresponds to the first value of `session_start` for this user from the Sessions table; and `last_session_end` corresponds to the last `session_end` for this user from the Sessions table.

The timestamps are calculated by default from the `derived_tstamp`. Change this in the SQL code if you want to use a different timestamp.

The time zone for `first_session_start` and `last_session_end` is set in the SQL code when defining the `page_view_start` and `page_view_end` fields. The time zone for `first_session_start_local` is derived from the time zone of the OS (by way of `page_view_start_local`).


##### 3.3.2.2 Optional time fields

As well as the core timestamp fields, you can also have a variety of derived time fields. Some examples are already included in the code for this model. They are:

| Field                                   | Type | Description                                                                | Example               |

| `first_session_time`                    | text | Time derived from `first_session_start`                                    | '2015-09-03 22:22:02' |
| `first_session_minute`                  | text | Time derived from `first_session_start`, truncated to the minute           | '2015-09-03 22:22'    |
| `first_session_hour`                    | text | Time derived from `first_session_start`, truncated to the hour             | '2015-09-03 22'       |

| `first_session_year`                    | int  | Year derived from `first_session_start`                                    | 2015                  |
| `first_session_local_time`              | text | Time derived from `first_session_start_local`                              | '2015-11-17 15:13:53' |
| `first_session_local_time_of_day`       | text | Hour and minute derived from `first_session_start_local`                   | '15:13'               |
| `first_session_local_hour_of_day`       | int  | Hour derived from `first_session_start_local`                              | 15                    |
| `first_session_local_day_of_week`       | text | Day of week derived from `first_session_start_local`, on a scale of 1 to 7 | '4'                   |
| `first_session_local_day_of_week_index` | int  | Day of week derived from `first_session_start_local`, on a scale of 0 to 6 | 0                     |

`first_session_quarter` indicates the quarter by the starting month, so '2015-07' is the 'July quarter', or 'Q3'.


#### 3.3.3 Engagement fields

| Field                    | Type | Description                              | Example |

| `time_engaged_in_s`      | int  | Time spent by the user across all visits | 320     |

`time_engaged_in_s` assumes `page_ping`s have been set to fire every 10 seconds. Change the setting in the SQL code to match your own settings.
